# sudoku

A Sudoku gameboard with a hint and solver function.

Hover the mouse over a position and type to enter a number. You will be prevented from entering any rule violating numbers into a position. Click “Hint” to fill out a random box on the grid, or click “Solution” to get the solution. If the puzzle is impossible, an alert will appear. Click “Clear” to clear the screen, or “Edit” to turn on editing mode. In editing mode, number at current mouse position will be erased upon typing.

Solver is based upon recursive backtracking logic.
